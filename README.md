**GitLab Old Branch Delete**

This is a python script that can be used to automate branch management in GitLab. The way the script works is it iterates over all the projects within your groups and checks the age of the branch. You can modify the age threshold to your preference (in days - default is 7 days old). The script will check the age of the branch versus the threshold age and if the branch is older than the threshold, it will be deleted (main/master branches will not be deleted regardless its' age).

Lets take a look at the script. You dont need to understand the script completely, all you need to know is:

- First, the script utilizes a Personal Access Token generated by GitLab. `Here` https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens
- Once the Access Token is aqcuired, create an .env file within the GROW folder. Inside the file, add the following: ACCESS_TOKEN = "(your access token here)"
- Adjust the number found in the THRESHOLD variable (currently set to days=7) to your preference.
- Finally, run the script and you can check your projects and notice your old branches have been removed!

That is all that is currently available to this project. Soon to come, automating the script to run on a scheduled time.
